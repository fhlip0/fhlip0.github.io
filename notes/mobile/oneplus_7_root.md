Rooting my new testing toy - oneplus 7t, and attempting to live note / blog it up here so i have steps to follow in the future again

Platform tools for mac
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip

Enable developer options from settings / about / tab software versiom 5 times
Enable usb debugging and oem unlocking in settings

./adb reboot bootloader

./fastboot oem unlock
! If error on unlocking, you didnt enable oem unlocking
select unlock bootloader and allow the device to wipe

flash twrp
https://dl.twrp.me/hotdog/twrp-installer-3.6.0_11-0-hotdog.zip

install magisk
https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/download/v24.1/Magisk-v24.1.apk

errrr it was at this point, that i fucked up


In my rush to install twrp - i flashed the whole phone with twrp... thus i can get twrp and not the actual OS now...   
https://www.droidwin.com/restore-oneplus-7-7t-pro-stock-via-fastboot-commands/   

retreived stock os from https://www.oneplus.in/support/softwareupgrade   

comes as a zip and a payload.bin file? - need to unpack it apparently - https://www.mediafire.com/file/pslxh616isribx6/payload_dumper.zip/file   

`python3 ./payload_dumper.py ../payload.bin`   

<img src="extracted.png" alt="dumped_payload.bin" width="600"/>

copied my fastboot command from platform tools into the output folder  

reboot back to fastboot   

now run this pile of fastbook

```


a few hours later... 

fastboot flash boot lineage recovery from https://download.lineageos.org/guacamole    
SIGNS OF LIFE   


aaaaand 24 hours more later   
https://rootmygalaxy.net/unbrick-t-mobile-oneplus-7t-and-restore-using-msm-tool/

msm "unbrick tool" for my tmobile specific oneplus7t did the trip, booted in EDL mode and let it do its job... so glad i tried this before attempting some hell with parted and trying to manually recreate the missing system partition    



soooooo no back to the beginning of saturday, i need to root and basic setup    
nice and easy this time - https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-android-11-how-to-root-oneplus-7t.4253183/  


developer options / build 7 times / developer options enabled, unlocking oem unlocking enabled  
oem unlocking fails, its definitely ticked in settings

running through the get_unlock_code deal and waiting for the code from oneplus / tmobile    
https://www.oneplus.com/support/answer/detail/op588


03-7-2022 - UNLOCK CODE ARRIVED - https://www.oneplus.com/unlock_token?type=1&apply_id=NUMBER

IMEI : 9900*******004
Serial Number : 49***aa3
Email : fhl******@gmail.com

```
./fastboot flash cust-unlock ./unlock_code.bin
./fastbook oem unlock

./fastbook flash recovery ./twrp-3.6.0_11-0-hotdog.img

copied over magisk apk from - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/tag/v24.2   
booted recovery / twrp   
installed magisk.apk   
reboot   


now to get SSL pinning bypassed...  

navigate to burp proxy in chrome  
download burp cert and rename der to cer  
install for wifi and apps / vpn  
add this module (zipped) to magisk - https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts/releases/tag/v0.4.1    
traffic is now proxying successfully   


added bonus of hiding magisk and deny listing the target app to bypass root detection
